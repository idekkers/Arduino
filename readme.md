# Arduino code for hydrophonics system

This system uses 2 arduino (currently micro) boards to control a hydrophonics system.

## board 1 - sensor and water level and flow
This board is connected to multiple sensors - all optional, 
that are used to monitor both water and environent.
The board id also used to control water level in the reservoir, and water flow to the system.

## board 2 - control
This board is used to control the water PH level and nutrients,
light levels, air temprature and co2 levels.
